              key (`tls.key`);
              - a PEM-encoded CA certificate (`ca.crt`)

              and whichever are supplied, will be used for connecting to the
              registry. The client cert and key are useful if you are
              authenticating with a certificate; the CA cert is useful if
              you are using a self-signed server certificate. The Secret must
              be of type `Opaque` or `kubernetes.io/tls`.

              Note: Support for the `caFile`, `certFile` and `keyFile` keys have
